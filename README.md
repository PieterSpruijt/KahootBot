 Spam Kahoot with bots - node.js  
 
# How to use  
 ## 1. Clone this repo  
 `git clone https://github.com/PieterSpruijt/KahootBot.git`  
 ## 2. Install required packages
 ```
 npm i
 ```
 Reason: kahoot.js-updated has been removed, but I still have an archived version
## 5. Execute script
 `node .`  

 ## NOTES:
 ### Each bot joins with a 250ms (.25s) delay to show up in numerical order AND to not get kicked for spam  
 ### On every question, each bot will automatically select the first answer. This makes for a hilarious wrong/right ratio
 ### Please use responsibly :)  
 ### Have fun and try not to annoy too many people  
 ###### Remember, don't use it for public Kahoots, only for private usage
